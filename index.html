            <h2>The Box Model is Key</h2>
            <div class="three-col">
                <p>The CSS box model describes the rectangular boxes that are generated for elements in the document tree and laid out according to the visual formatting model. </p>
                <p>Each box has a content area (e.g., text, an image, etc.) and optional surrounding padding, border, and margin areas; the size of each area is specified by properties defined below. The following diagram shows how these areas relate and the terminology used to refer to pieces of margin, border, and padding</p>
                <p>The margin, border, and padding can be broken down into top, right, bottom, and left segments. The perimeter of each of the four areas (content, padding, border, and margin) is called an &quot;edge&quot;.</p>

            <h2>The World is Going Mobile</h2>
            <div class="two-col">
                <p>We are increasingly becoming a mobile society, where our mobile devices enable us to better connect, communicate, share knowledge, and get stuff done. Ofcom report that smartphones have a 58% penetration within the UK market, tablets have a 19% reach. From apps which enable consumers to better engage with your brand, to websites that adapt, depending which device you are viewing them on and even internal apps which enable the more efficient running of your business - any business with growth ambitions should be looking hard at their mobile strategy.</p>
                <p>Blackberry opened the door to the always on, ever-reachable business world. Companies such as Apple and Google have stolen the march, creating enterprise-grade devices capable of connecting to the corporate IT infrastructure. Add to this Microsoft&#39;s ambitious hybridization of the personal computing market with the Windows 8 eco-culture, and the argument for engaging in touch, tablet and mobile for business are compelling.</p>
